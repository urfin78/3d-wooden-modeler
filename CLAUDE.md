# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

A browser-based 3D woodworking modeler — a single self-contained `index.html` file with no build tools, no frameworks, and no dependencies beyond Three.js r128 loaded via CDN.

## Development

No build step, no package manager, no tests. Open `index.html` directly in a browser to run. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript live in a single file.

## Architecture

Everything runs inside a `window.addEventListener('load', ...)` closure in `index.html`. The code is organized into clearly delimited sections:

1. **CSG BSP-Tree** — Constructive Solid Geometry implementation (Evan Wallace algorithm) for boolean subtraction between meshes. Key functions: `csgFromMesh`, `csgSubtract`.

2. **Three.js Scene Setup** — Renderer, camera, inline minimal OrbitControls, lighting, ground plane, auto-resizing grid (`updateGrid()`).

3. **Application State** — Global mutable state: `pieces[]` array, selection state, mode flags (snap, cut, overlap), undo/redo stacks.

4. **Shape Factory** — `makeBoard`, `makeDowel`, `makeWedge`, `makeLBracket`, `makeTaperedLeg`. Each returns a Three.js Mesh with a `userData` object storing type and dimensions. `addPiece()` registers meshes into the scene and `pieces[]`.

5. **Label System** — 3D sprite labels positioned above pieces using canvas-rendered textures.

6. **Selection & UI Binding** — `selectPiece()` updates the side panel form fields from `mesh.userData`. Input change handlers write back to `userData` and call `rebuildGeometry()`.

7. **Geometry Rebuild** — `rebuildGeometry(mesh)` recreates the mesh geometry from `userData` dimensions, preserving position/rotation. Critical path when dimensions change.

8. **Serialization & Undo** — `serializeScene()`/`restoreScene()` convert full scene state to/from JSON. Undo/redo pushes serialized snapshots.

9. **Save & Load** — `saveModel()` wraps serialized scene with metadata and triggers `.woodmodel.json` download. `loadModel()` reads the file and calls `restoreScene()`.

10. **Template Library** — Built-in metric templates + custom templates stored in `localStorage`. Integrated into toolbar add-piece dropdowns grouped by type.

11. **Cut Joint Mode** — Two-click workflow: select target, then tool piece. Calls `csgSubtract` and records notch info in `userData.notches`.

12. **Split Piece** — `splitSelected()` divides a Board or Dowel into parts along a chosen axis, subtracting kerf (saw blade thickness in mm). Two modes: "by number of parts" (equal-length pieces, kerf taken from each) or "by part length" (fixed target length, max pieces that fit). In length mode, an optional "Keep leftover as extra piece" checkbox preserves the remainder as a separate piece (costs one additional kerf for the separating cut). Kerf default is 3 mm; mode, kerf, and leftover preference persist in `localStorage` (`woodmodeler.splitKerf`, `woodmodeler.splitMode`, `woodmodeler.splitKeepLeftover`). Fixed prices are divided across all resulting parts (including leftover); per-mm prices are preserved. Pieces are laid out starting from the original's left edge (cut axis), keeping the original position/rotation. Not available for CSG-modified pieces.

13. **Overlap Detection** — Bounding-box intersection checks between all piece pairs.

14. **Cost Calculator** — Per-piece `userData.price` and `userData.priceMode` (fixed/per_mm). `updateCostSummary()` renders live totals in sidebar. Currency persisted in `localStorage`. CSV export includes cost columns.

15. **Mouse/Keyboard Interaction** — Raycasting for piece selection, drag-move (with snap support), keyboard shortcuts. Delete key is suppressed when an input is focused.

## Key Conventions

- Piece metadata lives in `mesh.userData` (type, dimensions, label, notches, price, priceMode).
- All dimensions are in millimeters.
- State mutations should be preceded by `pushUndo()` for undo support.
- The `pieces[]` array is the source of truth for all scene objects.
- When changing piece dimensions, always call `rebuildGeometry()` to recreate the mesh geometry.
- Call `updateGrid()` after any operation that changes piece positions or dimensions.

## Git Repo Conventions
- add a commit including message for changes
- work on feature branches, not directly on main
- merge to main via pull requests only (main branch is protected)
- when adding features or making changes, update both CLAUDE.md and README.md to reflect the current state
